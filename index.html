			<p class="bio">Born in Minnesota, Barry grew up in a small farming community in Iowa after moving there at the age of 5. After graduating high school two years early, he recieved a scholarship to study automotive engineering at a local college and earned his A.S. by 18. He moved to Santa Fe for a year, then to Seattle for four years, then finally landed in San Francisco where he decided to complete a B.S. in Economics at the University of San Francisco. It wasn't long after moving to Silicon Valley that he realized he wanted to be a part of the tech scene and began coding. He's now following his passion... </p>

			<p class="bio">Barry loves anything having to do with the great outdoors--snowboarding, hiking, camping, etc. He also loves restoring old automobiles and riding motos. But don't be fooled -- he's a real nerd at heart -- a serious follower of Star Trek and stints of Civ5, Barry can often be found hermitting out in his Cole Valley apartment.</p>
